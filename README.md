Provided files: The two .rar that needed to be cracked and opened. Screen shots show process tree from cracking the password hash with John the Ripper, decoding the hashes via hashes.com,setting up apache 2 server and transferring files to the var/www/, finding and decoding the base 64 in the view source code, using metasploit and two seperate exploits to backdoor into the vm and perform privilege escalation.
